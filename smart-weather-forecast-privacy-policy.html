        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 27, 2026</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Smart Weather Forecast ("we", "our", or "the app") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Location Information</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Precise Location:</strong> GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) when you grant location permission</li>
            <li><strong>Approximate Location:</strong> Network-based location when GPS is unavailable</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> City name, country, and coordinates are stored locally on your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Location permission is optional. You can use the app by manually selecting a city instead of using automatic location detection.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 App Preferences</h3>
        <p>The app stores the following preferences locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Temperature unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)</li>
            <li>Wind speed unit (m/s, km/h, mph)</li>
            <li>Pressure unit (hPa, mmHg, inHg)</li>
            <li>Precipitation unit (mm, inches, cm)</li>
            <li>Visibility unit (km, miles, meters)</li>
            <li>Notification preferences</li>
            <li>Saved location (if manually selected)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>1.3 Weather Data</h3>
        <p>Weather information retrieved from weather services is cached locally on your device to improve performance and enable offline access. This data includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Current weather conditions</li>
            <li>Temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure</li>
            <li>Weather forecasts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>1.4 Crash Reports and Error Data</h3>
        <p>To improve app stability and fix bugs, the app automatically collects crash reports and error information when the app encounters errors or crashes. This data includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> Stack traces, error messages, and crash logs</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, Android version, app version</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Crash reports do not contain personal information such as your name, email, or location. They only include technical data necessary to identify and fix bugs.</p>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Location Data</h3>
        <p>Your location information is used solely for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Retrieving weather data for your current location</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.4 Crash Reports</h3>
        <p>Crash reports are used solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and fix bugs in the app</li>
            <li>Improve app stability and performance</li>
            <li>Prevent future crashes</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Crash reports are automatically sent to Firebase Crashlytics (a Google service) for analysis. This data helps us improve the app but does not include any personal information.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Weather API Providers</h3>
        <p>To provide weather forecasts, the app shares your location coordinates with the following third-party weather service providers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OpenWeatherMap</strong> (<a href="https://openweathermap.org/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
            <li><strong>Open-Meteo</strong> (<a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/docs" target="_blank">Documentation</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These providers use your location coordinates solely to return weather data. Please review their privacy policies to understand how they handle data.</p>
        
        <h3>3.2 Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
        <p>To improve app stability, the app uses <strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> (a Google service) to collect and analyze crash reports. Crash reports include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Technical error information (stack traces, error messages)</li>
            <li>Device information (model, Android version, app version)</li>
            <li>App state at the time of crash</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is sent to Google's Firebase servers and is subject to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Firebase Terms of Service</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Crash reports do not contain personal information, location data, or any identifiable user information. They are purely technical data used for debugging purposes.</p>
        
        <h3>3.3 No Data Sale or Advertising</h3>
        <p>We do <strong>NOT</strong>:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Share your data with advertisers</li>
            <li>Use your data for advertising purposes</li>
            <li>Use analytics or tracking for advertising or marketing</li>
            <li>Share your information with any other third parties except weather API providers and Firebase Crashlytics (for crash reporting only)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Local Storage</h3>
        <p>Most of your data is stored locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences and local cache. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location preferences</li>
            <li>App settings</li>
            <li>Cached weather data</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Crash reports are sent to Firebase Crashlytics (Google's servers) for analysis. These reports are stored on Google's servers and are subject to Google's data retention policies. However, they do not contain personal information.</p>
        <p><strong>No Personal Data on Our Servers:</strong> We do not store any personal information, location data, or user preferences on our servers.</p>
        
        <h3>4.2 Data Transmission</h3>
        <p>When the app communicates with weather API providers and Firebase Crashlytics:</p>

            <li>You can revoke location permission in your device settings</li>
            <li>You can use the app without location permission by manually selecting a city</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.2 Notification Permission</h3>
        <p>Weather notifications are optional:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can enable or disable notifications in app settings</li>
            <li>You can revoke notification permission in your device settings</li>

            <li>Clearing app cache in your device settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Crash reports that have already been sent to Firebase Crashlytics cannot be deleted by uninstalling the app, as they are stored on Google's servers. However, these reports do not contain any personal information.</p>
        
        <h3>5.4 Access to Your Data</h3>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have direct access to it. The app does not maintain any external database of user information. Crash reports are stored on Firebase servers but do not contain personal information.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The app is suitable for all ages and does not require user registration or personal information beyond location data (which is optional).</p>
        
        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
